Great question — a `.sh` **won't run automatically** on startup *by itself*. But if you **connect it to a `systemd` service**, **then yes**, it *will* run automatically at startup.

## ✅ To Make Your `.sh` Run at Startup

You already created the shell script:

```bash
/home/user/ros2_ws/start_astra_camera.sh
```

Now follow these steps to **connect it to a systemd service** (if you haven’t already):

---

### 🛠 Step-by-Step: Hook the `.sh` to systemd

#### 1. Create the service file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/astra_camera.service
```

Paste this in:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Start Astra Camera and Image Analyze on Boot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=user
ExecStart=/home/user/ros2_ws/start_astra_camera.sh
Restart=on-failure
Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

> 🔁 Replace `user` with your actual username (you can run `whoami` to check).

---

#### 2. Reload and enable the service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable astra_camera.service
```

You can now test it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start astra_camera.service
```

Check logs or status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status astra_camera.service
```

---

### ✅ Now the `.sh` Will Run on Boot

Every time you reboot, the script will auto-run via `systemd`. If you want to confirm after reboot:

```bash
sudo systemctl status astra_camera.service
```

Want it to **log output** to a file? I can show you how to add that too!
